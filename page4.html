        <p>A pop-up model allows for rapid adaptability and responsiveness to arising issues and new findings. The agility of its structure makes it possible to create a dynamic organization of actors and to facilitate access to different locations. The temporary nature of a pop-up model and its flexibility depending on context and local specificities present less obstacles in pursing innovative projects. It is inherently a space for new ideas and experimentation, which can quickly adapt to findings and new needs. As a consequence, it is possible to take more creative risks and to brainstorm new strategies.</p>
        <p>The Edgelands Institute provided the space, the resources and the network to encourage actors from different fields and sectors of society to reflect on their experiences collectively. Regular diagnostic reports by core members of the Institute documented and analyzed the projects undertaken by researchers, artists and other participants. Its publications reported also on specific themes and contexts, adapting thus to the needs of a specific group or location in question. More generally, the projects undertaken by the Edgeland Institute’s participants addressed contemporary issues as they take place, taking into account not only expert input but also the perspectives of ordinary citizens.</p>

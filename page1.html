        <p>Temporary by definition, a pop-up structure creates a sense of novelty and urgency. This in turn heightens the curiosity and anticipation among residents in a given location, promoting active participation and engagement. A pop-up model can quickly respond to a new emerging need within a community and provide a light infrastructure for new collaborative projects to emerge. It acts like a spark, facilitating a quick initial response to local issues by community members themselves.</p>
        <p>First and foremost, a pop-up structure can develop new networks and the exchange of ideas among actors who might not have otherwise been in regular contact. It thereby increases visibility and raises awareness of new issues within a community and promotes engagement among members.</p>
        <p>Based in several cities in the world, the Edgelands Institute developed projects with community members on critical location-specific issues, such as discriminatory surveillance practices, relations between locals and immigrants, perception of security, and the impact of digital technology on one’s experience of the social contract. Organized around workshops, art exhibitions and other closely-knit collaborative platforms, these projects facilitated discussion, dynamically confronted different perspectives and elicited new ideas. These small-scale discussion platforms made it possible for specific groups of the community to share their lived experience with others, to consolidate a network and to devise strategies to tackle these issues together. The following multimedia documents are a representation of how a pop-up model facilitates community engagement.</p>

        <summary>Sub-series 1: Houston Pop-Up</summary>
            <p>Community engagement in Houston (TX), USA in a fight against discriminatory surveillance and racism. Through social and cultural organizing in local communities, this project aims to curtail the detrimental and long-lasting effects of data gathering on minorities, and especially on the African American children in public schools. This community engagement works also at bridging the gap between generations around digital technology in order to strengthen engagement potential and improve the social contract.</p>

            <p>Glitch Lab Art Residency & Art Show. The Glitch Lab was a social practice art residency developed by the Edgelands Institute and the NOTICE Coalition, in Houston, Texas, merging art, research and community organizing. Over a 5-month period, a diverse range of participants (artists, students and educators) explored the intersections of surveillance, education and youth justice. It created a vibrant environment for experimentation and civic engagement, culminating in an art exhibition at the Friends Gallery in Houston. The work focused particularly on disproportionate digital surveillance of minorities and marginalized youth, and on the development of new tools for resistance.</p> -->

        <summary>Sub-series 2: Edgelands Maps Project</summary>
            <p>Edgelands Maps was a thought-provoking workshop series organized by the Edgelands Institute, where participants delved into the intricacies of the modern social contract and the evolving dynamics of security and surveillance in our physical and digital spaces. The Edgelands Institute provided the tools and a safe inclusive space for diverse groups of young individuals to engage in discussions on their own experience and perception of security in everyday life. These workshops were organized in several partner cities around the world (Medellín and Cúcuta in Colombia, and Geneva, Switzerland), focusing on location-specific issues experienced by the participants. The accounts of personal perception and experience on the ground detailed in the following documents provide a crucial element for our understanding of a question as complex and contemporary as the trade-offs that are sometimes made between personal freedoms and security measures.</p>

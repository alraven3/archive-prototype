        <p>Welcome to the Edgelands Institute Archive.</p>
        <h2>The Edgelands Institute</h2>
        <p>Founded in 2020, the Edgelands Institute has had the primary mission of studying the increasing digitalization of security in cities and of exploring models of urban coexistence or social contracts. By bringing together researchers, artists and ordinary citizens throughout the world, the Edgelands Institute created dynamic spaces for dialogue and a diversity of perspectives, both on and offline. This was made possible through a series of collaborative programs and interdisciplinary projects, developed both virtually and in five major cities in the world: Houston (USA), Medellín and Cúcuta (Colombia), Geneva (Switzerland) and Nairobi (Kenya).</p>
        <p>While digital security is a global issue, the way we coexist as a society and the trade-offs we are willing to make for the sake of security depend greatly on the cultural, social and political contexts. It was thus important to always articulate local specificities and needs with the global perspective. This was facilitated by digital technology, as a way to increase collaboration and exchange of ideas between participants in the five partner cities.</p>
        <h2>The Edgelands Network</h2>
        <p>Over the course of its existence, the Edgelands Institute has built a vast international network of participants, consisting of artists, researchers, policy makers, community organizers, among others.</p>
        <p><i>For an interactive visualization of this network, click on the “Edgelands Network” link below.</i> This network is one of the tools developed by the Edgelands Institute to facilitate future collaborations and can be accessed in conjunction with the Archive of the documents created by members of the Edgelands Institute.</p>

        <h2>Edgelands - A Pop-Up Institute</h2>
        <p>The methodology of the Edgelands Institute was fundamentally connected to its pop-up nature, and thus its limited duration. The pop-up model, and the energy it brings, is central to the work conducted at Edgelands. While more common in commercial endeavors (pop-up stores, for example), a pop-up structure in social, artistic and academic organizations allows for new and innovative ways to develop public engagement on crucial contemporary issues. It facilitates a horizontal form of collaboration among a diverse range of actors and stakeholders. It becomes easier to break down the barriers of accessibility and diversity of experience that so often exist in traditional academic and policymaking circles. It was immediately manifest that this model created excitement around events, which in turn contributed to spreading awareness about the complex issues at stake. For more on the pop-up methodology, see the following article: {…}.</p>
        <h2>Archiving the ephemeral</h2>
        <p>...</p>
        <h2>The Edgelands Institute Archive - An archive of the future</h2>
        <p>While this pop-up Institute is ephemeral in nature, intended to exist for a limited duration, the collaborations and production of experience and knowledge have left a trace in the form of publications, artwork, podcasts, discussion forums and other documents. Throughout the existence of the Edgelands Institute (2020-2026), it has been important to systematically document this dynamic of collaboration and creation, as a way to leave lasting building blocks for future developments. This archive also documents the concrete effects of a pop-up institute beyond its existence. Just as a pop-up structure facilitates experimentation and interactions between different fields and disciplines, the Archive consists of XXXX documents, in different media (text, audio, video, photography, mixed-media, podcasts), created by various types of actors.</p>
        <p><b><i>An archive is always an archive of the future.</i></b></p>
        <p>An archive is there for new interpretation, interaction, contextualization and it leads us to ask the following question: What kind of future do we want? For this reason, the objective of this archive is not only to preserve the creations of the past, but to serve as a tool for future actions, experiences and development of ideas. The Edgelands Institute Archive is based on a hybrid model. It is classical in the sense that it systematically documents all items within the Edgelands fonds, providing key descriptions and information. At the same time, it has the ambition of inspiring new action, of serving as a model for future structures based on the pop-up methodology and its primary benefits for social, artistic and academic institutions. Detailed information about the archive can be found on the main archive page below.</p>
